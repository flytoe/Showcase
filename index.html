                    <p>Prototyper is a desktop application which allows you to make your ideas tangible. It offers options you just know from overloaded design- and complex animation-software. Prototyper unifies the worlds of animation, designing and interaction in one perfectly suited tool. Suddenly you have new opportunities to experience your ideas in early planing stages during the design process. With Prototyper you can design pixel-perfect and remain flexible at all times. You can have working prototypes within minutes, without having to translate your designs into code. With Prototyper you can explore interactions with graphical user interfaces more quickly and develop and test it faster. So you have more time to plan the next big thing.</p>
